For all $n\geq 1$, $\Id_n$ is the identity matrix of size $n\times n$  and $\mathbf{1}_n$ is the vector of size $n$ with all entries equal to 1. For all matrix $A\in\rset^{n\times d}$, $A^\top$ is the transpose of $A$. For all $1\leqslant i\leqslant n$, $A_{i,.}$ is the column vector given by the $i$-th row of $A$ and for all $1\leqslant j\leqslant d$, $A_{.,j}$ is the column vector given by the $j$-th column of $A$. For all $(a_1,\ldots,a_p)\in\rset^p$, $\diag(a_1,\ldots,a_p)$ is the diagonal matrix of size $p\times p$ with diagonal given by $(a_1,\ldots,a_p)$.
